This repository contains the solutions to the SQL Project- Analyzing Students' Mental Health available on <a href = "https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/1593">DataCamp</a> 

### Project Overview:
The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

The project aims to analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in a Japanese University.

The project's solution and analysis are provided in this file- [Analyzing_Students'_Mental_Health.md](https://github.com/SpenzTech/DataCamp_Associate-Data-Analyst-in-SQL-track/blob/main/3.%20Project/Analyzing_Students'_Mental_Health.md)
